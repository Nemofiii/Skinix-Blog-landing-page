                <span>by Jennifer Rock</span>
                <br>
                <p>Rome wasn’t built in a day, and baby steps, and the hare and the tortoise - you know the story!  Listen, even your skin needs time - it takes approximately 28 days for a skin cycle to complete, so patient is the best thing that you can be!

                    At the moment, we have a chance to take good care of ourselves, and our skin. Our philosophy is all about caring for the skin from the inside, on the outside, and on top. So what can we do to make sure that our skin is as healthy as possible? With baby steps in mind, I’m thinking this week about little changes that we can all make to make sure our skin is as healthy as possible - manageable, simple and completely doable from home. </p>

                <br>
                <p>Not to boast, but I have been blessed with good skin! Having said that, my mother has always stressed the importance of maintaining my skin. So, while I do ensure that I get my daily dose of minerals and vitamins in my diet, I also have experimented with several homemade face packs and masks so that my skin gets the nutrients it needs. Your skin is a reflection of how healthy your insides are and the secret to amazing skin is honestly food and exercise.</p>

                <br>
                <p>During the summer months it's natural to want to treat yourself to something a little bit different, considering that we all have a little more time on our hands. I don't personally believe that you need to change your routine drastically between the seasons, but it does make sense that people might want to experiment a little bit with this extra time and space. At the core, I truly believe in mixing and matching products that suit yours skin and will help to protect and nourish it from the inside all the way to the outside.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Choosing a mask for your skin can really be the cherry on the top of your routine. There’s such a wealth of product available out there that hoomans can sometimes make the mistake of thinking that a mask is a mask, and as long as you can slap it on the turn up the Enya in the background, you’re onto a good thing. This is not always the case (but you should always be blasting Enya, in my opinion).  </p>

                <p>Love is the best anti-aging treatment
                    Oxytocin, dopamine, and serotonin have positive effects on your skin by increasing anti-inflammatory responses, repairing the skin barrier, and improving microcirculation. All of that boosts your skin's radiance and gives you a free anti-aging treatment.</p>

                <span>by Aaron Jade</span>
                <br>
                <p>SPF 15, SPF 30, SPF 50 … have you ever stood in the sunscreen aisle wondering, “What does SPF mean?” If so, now’s a great time to bring yourself up to speed on the basics. The SPF number ratings you see on sunscreen bottles are important, but they’re not the only factor to consider when it comes to selecting a sunscreen that will help protect your skin from the damaging rays of the sun.</p>
